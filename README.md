This tool is able to change Link animations in the ROMs (Debug and NTSC), ZZRT and ZZRTL projects, and manage remaining space.
The tool automatically repoints and reinserts data and calculates how many more frames can fit in.
Space can be freed by importing a smaller animation than was present in the original.

The animations can be created by using <a href="https://github.com/sauraen/link-rig">Sauraen's Link rig</a> and exported using <a href="https://github.com/Dragorn421/io_export_objex">Objex2</a> (by checking the EXPORT LINK ANIM BINS) option.

Planned is also an ability to edit the animations within the tool.
